# 🌐 Language Detection using NLP (Machine Learning)

## 🔍 Overview
This project focuses on automatically identifying the **language** of a given text input using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning**. It includes end-to-end data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

Real-world applications include:
- Multilingual chatbots
- Social media moderation
- Content classification
- Customer support routing
- Translation services

## 🧠 Project Goals
- Clean and preprocess multilingual text
- Convert text into numerical vector representation
- Train a classification model
- Evaluate performance metrics
- Predict language for unseen text

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
| Component | Technology |
|----------|------------|
| Programming | Python |
| NLP | NLTK / spaCy |
| Vectorization | TF-IDF |
| Machine Learning | Logistic Regression / Multinomial Naive Bayes |
| Visualization | Matplotlib / Seaborn |
| Environment | Jupyter Notebook |

## 📦 Libraries Used
